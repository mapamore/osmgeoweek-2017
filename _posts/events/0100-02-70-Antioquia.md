Public conference summarizing the results of COASTMAP-URABÁ (Colombia) HOTOSM Microgrant 2017. This project was conducted as a partnership among faculty from engineering and natural sciences, supported by student volunteers from Universidad de Antioquia, and a collaboration with local fishing communities and institutions in Turbo (Antioquia). It was responsible for building the first humanitarian OpenStreetMap for a coastal area in Colombia in preparedness for river flash-flooding events and sea-level rise. This map covers nearly 190 km of coastline and a fringe of ca. 4 km. Nearly 24K buildings and 367 km of roads were put in the map during a series of mapathons. Detailed information about building features, as well as impact and resilience to a major flooding occurred in 2010-2011 during La Niña conditions were obtained during a field survey of a target fishing community (El Uno Bay). Descriptions were included in OSM and thematic maps were built in open GIS and shared with stakeholders, including teachers and high school students.
