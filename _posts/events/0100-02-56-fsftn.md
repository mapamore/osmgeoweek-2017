FSFTN is organizing a Mapjam Activity where you would map places around you upon contributing to OpenStreetMap. This event is a week-long mapathon starting from Nov 12th to Nov 17th. Participants will contribute to OpenStreetMap for the whole week. We maintain a Leaderboard which displays the top contributor for this week in the Mapathon.
