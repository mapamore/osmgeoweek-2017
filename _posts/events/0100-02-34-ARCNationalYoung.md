The American Red Cross National Young Professionals Council is partnering with OSM Geo Week to create an online event for young professionals and our network of colleagues and supporters. We are asking participants to give an hour during the week of November 12-18 to join us for a nationwide virtual mapping event. You can chose your hour (or more if you like), then register for a ticket. You will then receive an email with directions on how to access Missing Maps and a feedback form to help us learn more about your experience. For more information on this event, email Samia at samia.ghouse@redcross.org. Each year, disasters around the world kill nearly 100,000 and affect or displace 200 million people. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally 'missing' from any map and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project in which you can help to map areas where humanitarian organisations are trying to meet the needs of vulnerable people. Established by a joint resolution of the U.S. Congress in 1987, Geography Awareness Week (GAW) is observed the third week in November every year. GAW promotes what geography is, why it is important, and the relevance of a geographic education in preparing citizens to understand and debate pressing social and environmental issues and problems. This year’s celebration is November 12-18, marking the 30th birthday of what has become an important tradition in our discipline! Thanks for joining NYPC as we pilot this virtual mapping event, and Happy Geo Week!
