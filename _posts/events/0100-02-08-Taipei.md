The monthly Taipei meetup will be hold early a week to celebrate OSMGeoWeek. We'll focus on crisis mapping, teaching how to use the latest Task Manager 3 to collaborate and distribute the area to map, helping cultivate the geo map data that the crisis area needed. We'll also look at the traditional Chinese translation of Task Manager 3, looking if the terms are well translated. And we'll look at the LearnOSM material, set the priority which part to translate first.
