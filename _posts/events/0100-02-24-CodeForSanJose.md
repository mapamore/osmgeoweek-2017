OpenStreetMap Sidewalk Mapathon! A Mapathon of the South Bay OSM Community. The focus of this meeting will be to put a serious dent into the San Jose Sidewalk import project (http://tasks.openstreetmap.us/project/127). This is a crucial step towards creating a pedestrian network for San Jose. If you want to learn a little bit about why we are doing this please check out the OpenSidewalks Project (https://www.opensidewalks.com/).
