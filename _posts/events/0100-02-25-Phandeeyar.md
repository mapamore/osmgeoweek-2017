We'll be celebrating OSM Geo Week and Myanmar GIS Day on 15th November 2017 at the Yangon University. We'll discuss what OSM is and its different use cases. We'll also discuss the different tools to contribute to OSM. We'll also have a "Mapathon" and "Outside Mapping" for map enthusiasts to come together and collaboratively contribute to the development of the map of Myanmar.
