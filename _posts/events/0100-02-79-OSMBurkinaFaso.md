Through partnership with CartONG and support from Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, we will hold 2 days to raise awareness about OSM and the mapping to prevent malaria. Malaria affects 9 million people, and kills 4,000 people each year in Burkina Faso. Mapping Bobo Dioulasso will help health services to better prevent and understand the most at-risk malaria areas. 16/11 : Plea for OSM ecosystem 17/11 : Mapathon to fight malaria
