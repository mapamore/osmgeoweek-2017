Please join us for our 4th annual Geographic Education / OpenStreetMap Awareness Week!

In honor of GeoWeek, we will be hosting a Mapathon at the National Geographic Society headquarters located in downtown DC.

The purpose of this event is to actively contribute to humanitarian projects using OpenStreetMap. We will have guest speakers from partnering humanitarian organizations and a presentation from National Geographic staff working on the Okavango Delta Project.
