Looking to hone your mapping skills and contribute to community resilience at the same time? Join us on Friday, November 17, when we will hold our first mapathon in the GIC (with free pizza!). We will teach you how to map Williams Lake, BC, as part of the Building Canada 2020 Initiative. Wildfires in BC this summer heavily affected Williams Lake, and the information that we map will help first responders and emergency aid to better locate and help the residents of Williams Lake in the future. Beginners & experienced mappers, undergraduate & graduate students, faculty & staff, members of the public, all are welcome to join OMG McGill for the mapathon AND on GIS Day. Please bring your laptop (though we will have some computers available)!
