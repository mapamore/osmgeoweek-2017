Come join VTA staff to celebrate international GIS (geographic information systems) Day. This event is open to members of the public or technical professionals with an interest in geospatial and transportation data. Learn about the many ways GIS can provide solutions for YOUR project needs. Including public outreach and crowdsourcing, work assignments, and visualizing data via dashboards. There will be lightning talks from VTA staff and Mapillary, crowdsourced street-level imagery. There will be interactive GIS stations, aerial photo challenge, lightning talks, prizes, and refreshments. This year’s event is sponsored by Swiftly, Mapillary, and Latitude Geographics.
