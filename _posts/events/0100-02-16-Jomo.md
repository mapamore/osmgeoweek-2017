#OSMGeoWeek is community effort aimed at encouraging new volunteer mappers to participate in OpenStreetMap-based projects while supporting open data and open mapping. The JKUAT Chapter is participating in the event, presenting an opportunity for students to be part of something that is both meaningful as well as fun. In addition, learning OSM and becoming a volunteer requires no special expertise, basic computer skills would just suffice.
