Monday Nov. 6th from 2:00-4:00 in the DSI Classroom (360 Shields Library), join the UC Davis Mapping Club for an Open Street Map Map-a-Thon! What is a map-a-thon? It's a time to get together with as many people as possible to contribute to the open source project Open Street Map. The event will include a lesson on how to get started and have lots of help. Whether you're brand new or are a seasoned OSM editing pro, join us for this fun event! This workshop is a part of the #maptime Davis workshop series. #maptimeDavis is brought to you by the UC Davis Library’s Data Management Program & the UC Davis Center for Spatial Sciences with help from several campus clubs and informal learning groups. Space is generously provided by the Data Science Initiative (DSI).
