Join HMS on November 17th in celebrating OpenStreetMap Geography Awareness Week! We will be live competing with George Mason's Mason Mappers and the University of Maryland's Geography Club. The event will take place in the South Hall Community Room. Mapping tasks coming soon! We will have a training starting at 6pm for new mappers, while experienced mappers can come at 6 and get started mapping. Pizza and refreshment will be available mid-way through the event. HMS T-shirts are on the way and will be available for purchase at the event. Please be sure to bring your laptop, charger, mouse (if you have one) and positive energy! We look forward to seeing you there!
