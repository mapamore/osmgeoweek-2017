Development Seed is hosting a Machine Learning Mapathon as part of OpenStreetMap Geography Awareness Week. We'll focus on tasks that improve automatic road detection in Vietnam. By mapping parts of Vietnam, attendees will take part in training a machine how to recognize highways and rural roads in the country. We'll kick off the evening with a short presentation and demonstration on machine learning, and give a brief overview of Skynet - an end-to-end set of tools for extracting useful data from a machine learning process.

You don't need to be an expert mapper to participate! We'll help get you set up in order to contribute to the tasks.
