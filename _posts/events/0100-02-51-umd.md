We will be participating in a mapathon for OSM GeoWeek along with other universities. A friendly competition has been added to see, which school can map the most tasks towards a project. No experience is necessary. We will provide training at the beginning of the session for those unfamiliar with using OpenStreetMap and will have experienced users providing support throughout the event. Come out to map for relief, compete against GW and GMU, as well as enjoy food.
