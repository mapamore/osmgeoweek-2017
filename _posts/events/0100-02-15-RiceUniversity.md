Humanitarian efforts around the world are being revolutionized by access to crowd-sourced geographic data. Now, you can learn how to become a trained volunteer who contributes to this movement. Come to our Mapathon event on November 15th in Sewall Hall 303 (laptop needed, BUT NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY) where you will: -Open an Open Street Map Account and learn how easy it is to map -Listen to Dr. Farhan Majid, a fellow from the Baker Institute, speak about global health -Help complete a PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief) mapping task for a mission in Northern Uganda -Meet a community of mappers, including our very own Fondren GIS/DATA center volunteers -GET FREE FOOD!!! This event is supported by the Fondren GIS/DATA Center Sonia Torres, a State Department's Virtual Student Federal Service Intern for the MY DATA: Mobilizing Youth on Data for Action and Transformation in Africa project.
