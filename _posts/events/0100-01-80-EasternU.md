YouthMappers at Eastern University (Proposed), Bangladesh is going to organize Training and Introducing OSM to the freshers through celebrating GEOWeek 2017. For mapping we are going to use tools like iD editor and JOSM to map our local place in Bangladesh. Event goal is to cultivate a generation of young people to become leaders in creating resilient communities and empowering them to define their world by mapping it.
