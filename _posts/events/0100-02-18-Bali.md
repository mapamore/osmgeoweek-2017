This mapathon is organized to continue mapping for hazard areas surrounding Agung Volcano. The event is co-organized by the Centre for Spatial Data Infrastructure Development (PPIDS) of Udayana University, partnering with HOT Indonesia, DMInnovation, and Indonesia's National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB). On September 22, 2017, Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources escalated Agung Volcano alert level to its peak. As a consequence, most people living near Agung Volcano had to be evacuated to the nearest IDP camps, at least 12 km from the hazard. This mapathon aims to collect exposure data, including buildings and roads, needed for further response, such as disaster risk analysis and disaster management activities by BNPB, Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD), PPIDS of Udayana University and local government as well as its surrounding communities.
