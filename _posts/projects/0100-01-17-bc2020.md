Building Canada 2020 is a community-led initiative driven by a simple and clear vision: map all buildings in Canada on OpenStreetMap by the year 2020.

This vision emerged from a combination of factors: the collaborations and discussions triggered from a related crowdsourcing project by Statistics Canada, the growing need to improve existing georeferenced data on buildings across all communities in Canada, and a genuine opportunity to explore new forms in co-production of open data.

Simple information on buildings (geolocation ref.WGS84, building footprint, full address: street #, street name, postal code, city, province; and type of use) is of major societal value. This information, however, is often lacking in some areas or not completely accessible on a single open data platform. Creating a nation-wide, freely accessible and non-proprietary source of information on buildings will contribute to the development of the data infrastructures of the future, upon which a multitude of public and private projects could thrive.

During OSMGeoWeek, universities across Canada will contribute to Building Canada 2020 by hosting mapathons. The mapathons will map building footprints in mostly rural regions of Canada where OSM data does not exist and where there are no pre-existing building footprint open datasets to import. To learn more about the mapathons, check out the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Canada/Building_Canada_2020/OSMGeoWeek2017">wiki page</a>.  

Tasks for the mapathons will be set up on the <a href="http://tasks.osmcanada.ca/">Canada OSM Tasking Manager</a>.
