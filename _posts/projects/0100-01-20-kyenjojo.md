The partnership aims to test an integrated health systems approach that addresses the “three delays” associated with maternal and newborn deaths.

Delays in seeking appropriate care Delays in reaching care in a timely manner Delays in receiving high-quality care at a health facility
Results from the partnership’s work in Uganda include a 45% decrease in maternal mortality in facilities and a 41% decrease in the communities; and a 97% increase in newborns who received HIV preventative medication.

This task focuses attention on the four phase I districts in western Uganda where the project’s approach was initially demonstrated: Kabarole, Kibaale, Kamwenge, and Kyenjojo districts. Understanding the second delay – ‘delays in reaching care in a timely manner’ – requires better understanding the roads connecting facilities with communities. The data that emerge from this mapping task will improve our knowledge of the relationships between access to and use of life-saving maternal and child health services.
